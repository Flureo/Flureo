# â˜• Good morning!
Hello **everyone**, I'm Flureo *(my name is McFlurry and oreo combind)* and I'm a sixteen-year-old Software Developer. I got into technology and programming at the age of twelve. The first programming I learn was C++ I know I'm make a lot of hard to believe claims and to be honst hard to prove claims. Do note that I wouldn't consider myself a *"Software Developer with four years of experience"* because most of the time was just spend learning things and not actaully developing anything. More time was spent playing video games then actually making cool projects and I mean can you even blame me that is what most kids of that age do now adays. I have started takeing Software Development more seriously and I now look at it as more of a career. I'm currectly learning web development so I can maybe get hired in the near future. And that is really all I have to say for now. Cya!
