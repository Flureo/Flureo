# ‚òï Good morning!

## ‚ùì Who am I?
  What's up **everyone**, it's nice to meet you all! My name is ***Flureo***, which is "McFlurry" and "Oreo" combined. I'm a *sixteen-year-old* **Software Developer.** I've been into programming since I was *twelve-year-old*. I also use **Neovim** and **Archlinux** by the way. Oh! And I'm homeschooled by the way.

## ü§î My Experience
  *Just because I've been learning programming for four years doesn't mean I have four years of experience in software development.* Most of my time was spent playing video games and in school. When I was working on programming, *I didn't make any projects* that I worked on for too long. But more recently, I've been taking programming more seriously as a career. ***C++*** was the *first programming language* that I learned, and to be honest, after adventuring to other programming languages, *they are all the same with a* ***different coat of paint***. The only thing you're learning when you switch to a new language is the *syntax*. If you know the basics of programming, like *functions, variables, pointers(in some languages), data structures, and classes,* you know *every programming language*. It's kind of like *Linux distros*. They are all the same, just with different package managers and desktop environments, *which can be changed in the future.* What I'm trying to say is that if I were required to learn a new programming language for a job, I would be willing to do it.

## üíº Currently Working On
  As of right now, I'm currently learning **web development**. I want to *pursue programming as a career*, and after some research, I've decided that web development is the *most efficient* way to get my foot in the door. As much as I love C++, I have to admit to the numbers. Plus, web development is a **weak point** of mine.

## ‚≠ê Goals
  **Become Ununemployed (Please hire me. üò¢).**
